# Challenge

### Limited Documentation

During the development of CreatorHub, we faced several challenges, with one of the most significant being the limited documentation available for ZKFetch. This scarcity of resources complicated our integration with the YouTube API, making the deployment process more complex and time-consuming. To overcome this hurdle, we are committed to engaging with the developer community surrounding ZKFetch. By participating in forums, Discord channels, and GitHub discussions, we aim to seek guidance from those who have navigated similar challenges. Additionally, we plan to document our findings and share solutions, contributing back to the community that supports us.

### Onboarding Experience for Creators

Another major challenge was creating a seamless onboarding experience for YouTube creators unfamiliar with Web3. Many creators find the technical aspects of blockchain and NFTs overwhelming. To address this, we integrated BASE Smart Wallet technology, allowing users to create or register a new wallet using just their email. This technology eliminates the complexities typically associated with setting up a crypto wallet, making it easier for creators to transition into the Web3 space.

To further enhance the onboarding experience, we will develop an intuitive guide or tutorial that walks creators through the steps of setting up their wallets and understanding Web3 fundamentals. Weâ€™ll incorporate videos, infographics, and FAQs to cater to various learning styles. Additionally, we will establish a dedicated support team and community managers to assist creators during their onboarding journey, providing answers to questions and personalized support as needed.

### Royalty-Sharing System Design

Lastly, we encountered challenges in designing a secure and transparent royalty-sharing system. Our goal is to ensure that NFT holders receive daily or monthly payouts in a fair and reliable manner. Striking the right balance between security and user-friendliness is crucial to making Web3 accessible for both creators and fans.

To achieve this, we will utilize established frameworks for smart contracts that efficiently and transparently manage royalty distributions. We are also considering partnerships with blockchain experts to audit and optimize our smart contracts, ensuring their security and reliability. Furthermore, we plan to build a user-friendly dashboard for creators to track their royalties, offering real-time insights into their earnings and performance. This transparency will foster trust and motivate creators to engage more deeply with the platform.
