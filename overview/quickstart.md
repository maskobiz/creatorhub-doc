# Problem

In the current Web2 landscape, **YouTube** creators face significant limitations regarding content ownership, monetization options, and direct engagement with their fan base. Platform algorithms dictate content reach, while revenue is largely controlled by ad-based models that lack transparency and restrict creator autonomy. This creates frustration, especially for those seeking sustainable ways to monetize and connect with audiences.

`According to data from June 2024 (Google Transparency Report), over 8 million videos were removed from YouTube, representing a significant loss of opportunities and revenue for creators.` \
\
With **CreatorHub**, we offer a solutionâ€”creators can secure their content on-chain, ensuring they never lose opportunities due to platform restrictions. By leveraging Web3, we empower creators to build independent, sustainable careers while maintaining full control over their content and monetization options.

Additionally, **CreatorHub** aims to bridge the gap between traditional Web2 platforms and the decentralized Web3 ecosystem by integrating Web3 features with YouTube's API, which was designed for Web2. This integration allows for smoother interactions between blockchain and YouTube, overcoming the limitations of the existing system.
