# Our Vision

At CreatorHub, we envision providing a platform where YouTube creators can easily mint their channels as NFTs, securing ownership and gaining control over their content in Web3. Our goal is to help creators transition seamlessly from Web2 to Web3 by introducing features like video minting, subscription programs via Super Pass, and royalty-sharing mechanisms.

With **Super Pass**, NFT holders can access exclusive content, allowing creators to deepen connections with their top fans. The royalty-sharing system will enable daily or monthly payouts to NFT holders, encouraging more active participation while providing creators with new income opportunities. We aim to make these features user-friendly, enabling creators to focus on their content while enjoying the benefits of Web3’s decentralized model.

CreatorHub will also implement subscriber tiers based on the YouTube Play Button system, allowing creators to unlock unique NFT images corresponding to their subscriber count:

* **Basic NFT (Under 10K Subscribers):** A foundational NFT marking a creator’s entry into the Web3 ecosystem.
* **Silver Play Button NFT (100K Subscribers):** A silver NFT symbolizing a creator’s achievement in building a substantial fanbase.
* **Gold Play Button NFT (1 Million Subscribers):** A unique gold NFT representing a significant milestone and fan engagement.
* **Diamond Play Button NFT (10 Million Subscribers):** A coveted diamond NFT for top-tier creators, signifying exceptional success and brand value.

These tiered NFTs will serve as both badges of honor and visual differentiators for creators, enhancing their branding within the Web3 ecosystem.
