# Welcome

Welcome to the CreatorHub project overview. We're thrilled to share our journey in empowering YouTube creators to seamlessly transition from Web2 to Web3. Our mission is to give creators the tools they need to take control of their content, engage with their fans, and explore new revenue opportunities in the decentralized ecosystem.
